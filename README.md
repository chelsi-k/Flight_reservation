Flight Reservation Systems help flight agencies in effective management of ticket booking and flight database.This project aims to provide a user-friendly system to assist users in booking flight tickets and to ensure fast and efficient working of database. It maintains records of flight tickets booked by users and details of the user are saved automatically in the database for future references and easier access. By creating an account, the user is allowed access to the database to book flight tickets and make necessary changes if required. If the user may wish, they could cancel their tickets too. By deleting your account, the system also deletes your previous bookings.
